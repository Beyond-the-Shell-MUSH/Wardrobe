Wardrobe is a simple global functionality that allows players to store various
outfits for easy switching during role playing sessions. The code does allow
outfits to have spaces in the name, which allows players to have more organic
outfit names. A list command makes it easier to find the outfit you are looking
for, as well as being easy to remove old, unneeded outfits.
